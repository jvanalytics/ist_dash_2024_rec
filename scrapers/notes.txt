scrapy notes:
- input in terminal on project folder "folder_name tree" to see folder structure from scrapy
- input in terminal on project folder write "folder_name scrapy shell" to go to scrapy shell that allows to debug the spider in a more interactive way than just using print statements. 
    Example: response.css('h2::text').get() will return the first h2 tag's of the response
- to debug output of scrapy crawl input "scrapy crawl name_of_spider"
- to get an output with file of scrapy crawl input "scrapy crawl name_of_spider -o filename.json"
